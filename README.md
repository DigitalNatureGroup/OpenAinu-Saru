This is the Github repo of OpenAinu-Saru project.
**This repo is still under construction.**



## Introduction

This repo contains our training and evaluation code files.

Currently this is not a repo that can work out-of-box, this is because we used our internal workflow to run these files.
Later we'll reformat these code to make a out-of-box repo.

**Currently, all the components needed to reproduce our results are included in the repo.** That includes:

- Functions we used to train/evaluate our models.
- The conda environment file.
- Tokenizers.
- Weights. 



## Obtaining the weights

An example set of weights can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/JacobZh/OpenAinu-Saru-25-Sep.





## Obtaining the dataset

While the dataset we are using are all public, we will not re-distribute the dataset here.
Instead, we encourage you to obtain them from official webpages.
[Ainu Folklore](https://ainu.ninjal.ac.jp/folklore/en/)

[Ainu Textbooks](https://www.ff-ainu.or.jp/web/potal_site/details/post.html) (Japanese)

We provided tool classes to those datasets; however, you are encouraged to use your own scheme to organize those datasets.
